abstract = {We describe a numerical algorithm to integrate the equations of radiation magnetohydrodynamics in multidimensions using Godunov methods. This algorithm solves the radiation moment equations in the mixed frame, without invoking any diffusion-like approximations. The moment equations are closed using a variable Eddington tensor whose components are calculated from a formal solution of the transfer equation at a large number of angles using the method of short characteristics. We use a comprehensive test suite to verify the algorithm, including convergence tests of radiation-modified linear acoustic and magnetosonic waves, the structure of radiation modified shocks, and two-dimensional tests of photon bubble instability and the ablation of dense clouds by an intense radiation field. These tests cover a very wide range of regimes, including both optically thick and thin flows, and ratios of the radiation to gas pressure of at least 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} to 10{\^{}}{\{}4{\}}. Across most of the parameter space, we find the method is accurate. However, the tests also reveal there are regimes where the method needs improvement, for example when both the radiation pressure and absorption opacity are very large. We suggest modifications to the algorithm that will improve accuracy in this case. We discuss the advantages of this method over those based on flux-limited diffusion. In particular, we find the method is not only substantially more accurate, but often no more expensive than the diffusion approximation for our intended applications.},

@article{Vink2018,
abstract = {One of the key questions in Astrophysics concerns the issue of whether there exists an upper-mass limit to stars, and if so, what physical mechanism sets this limit, which might also determine if the upper-mass limit is metallicity (Z) dependent. We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven winds mediated by line opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We present mass-loss predictions (dM/dt{\_}wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer models for relatively cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with large Eddington Gamma factors in the mass range 100-1000 Msun as a function of metallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version of our Monte Carlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt{\_}wind) and the terminal wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind terminal velocities (vinf) that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and we propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important source of self-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates (dM/dt{\_}wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt{\_}accr) of 0.001 Msun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as a function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74 log(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt {\&} reverse mass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar mergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar growth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively Z-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds. This has dramatic consequences for the most luminous supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and other black hole formation scenarios at different Cosmic epochs.},

abstract = {The high luminosity of Very Massive Stars (VMS) means that radiative forces play an important, dynamical role both in the structure and stability of their stellar envelope, and in driving strong stellar-wind mass loss. Focusing on the interplay of radiative flux and opacity, with emphasis on key distinctions between continuum vs. line opacity, this chapter reviews instabilities in the envelopes and winds of VMS. Specifically, we discuss how: 1) the iron opacity bump can induce an extensive inflation of the stellar envelope; 2) the density dependence of mean opacity leads to strange mode instabilities in the outer envelope; 3) desaturation of line-opacity by acceleration of near-surface layers initiates and sustains a line-driven stellar wind outflow; 4) an associated line-deshadowing instability leads to extensive small-scale structure in the outer regions of such line-driven winds; 5) a star with super-Eddington luminosity can develop extensive atmospheric structure from photon bubble instabilities, or from stagnation of flow that exceeds the "photon tiring" limit; 6) the associated porosity leads to a reduction in opacity that can regulate the extreme mass loss of such continuum-driven winds. Two overall themes are the potential links of such instabilities to Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and the potential role of radiation forces in establishing the upper mass limit of VMS.},

abstract = {We perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the structure and dynamics of the radiation-dominated envelopes of massive stars at the location of the iron opacity peak. One-dimensional hydrostatic calculations predict an unstable density inversion at this location, whereas our simulations reveal a complex interplay of convective and radiative transport whose behavior depends on the ratio of the photon diffusion time to the dynamical time. The latter is set by the ratio of the optical depth per pressure scale height, , 0 t to c c , c g t = where c 50 km s g 1 » -is the isothermal sound speed in the gas alone. When , 0 c t t  convection reduces the radiation acceleration and removes the density inversion. The turbulent energy transport in the simulations agrees with mixing length theory and provides its first numerical calibration in the radiation-dominated regime. When , 0 c t t  convection becomes inefficient and the turbulent energy transport is negligible. The turbulent velocities exceed c g , driving shocks and large density fluctuations that allow photons to preferentially diffuse out through low-density regions. However, the effective radiation acceleration is still larger than the gravitational acceleration so that the time average density profile contains a modest density inversion. In addition, the simulated envelope undergoes large-scale oscillations with periods of a few hours. The turbulent velocity field may affect the broadening of spectral lines and therefore stellar rotation measurements in massive stars, while the time variable outer atmosphere could lead to variations in their mass loss and stellar radius.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an update on the open source MPI-AMRVAC simulation toolkit where we focus on solar- and non-relativistic astrophysical magneto-fluid dynamics. We highlight recent developments in terms of physics modules such as hydrodynamics with dust coupling and the conservative implementation of Hall magnetohydrodynamics. A simple conservative high-order finite difference scheme that works in combination with all available physics modules is introduced and demonstrated at the example of monotonicity preserving fifth order reconstruction. Strong stability preserving high order Runge-Kutta time steppers are used to obtain stable evolutions in multidimensional applications realizing up to fourth order accuracy in space and time. With the new distinction between active and passive grid cells, MPI-AMRVAC is ideally suited to simulate evolutions where parts of the solution are controlled analytically, or have a tendency to progress into or out of a stationary state. Typical test problems and representative applications are discussed, with an outlook to follow-up research. Finally, we discuss the parallel scaling of the code and demonstrate excellent weak scaling up to 30 000 processors allowing to exploit modern petascale infrastructure.},

abstract = {Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXB) host a compact object, often a neutron star (NS), orbiting an evolved O/B star. Mass transfer proceeds through the intense line-driven wind of the stellar donor, a fraction of which is captured by the gravitational field of the NS. The subsequent accretion process onto the NS is responsible for the abundant X-ray emission from SgXB. They also display peak-to-peak variability of the X-ray flux by a factor of a few 10 to 100, along with changes in the hardness ratios possibly due to varying absorption along the line-of-sight. We use recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of inhomogeneities (aka clumps) in the non-stationary wind of massive hot stars to evaluate their impact on the time-variable accretion process. For this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the wind in the vicinity of the accretor to investigate the formation of the bow shock and follow the inhomogeneous flow over several spatial orders of magnitude, down to the NS magnetosphere. In particular, we show that the impact of the wind clumps on the time-variability of the intrinsic mass accretion rate is severely tempered by the crossing of the shock, compared to the purely ballistic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton estimation. We also account for the variable absorption due to clumps passing by the line-of-sight and estimate the final effective variability of the column density and mass accretion rate for different orbital separations. Finally, we compare our results to the most recent analysis of the X-ray flux and the hardness ratio in Vela X-1.},

abstract = {A transient gravitational-wave signal, GW150914, was identified in the twin Advanced LIGO detectors on 2015 September 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC. To assess the implications of this discovery, the detectors remained in operation with unchanged configurations over a period of 39 days around the time of the signal. At the detection statistic threshold corresponding to that observed for GW150914, our search of the 16 days of simultaneous two-detector observational data is estimated to have a false-alarm rate (FAR) of --4.9 10 yr 6 1 , yielding a p-value for GW150914 of -2 10 7 . Parameter estimation follow-up on this trigger identifies its source as a binary black hole (BBH) merger with component masses () ()  = -+ -+ m m M , 3 6 ,2 9 1 2 4 5 4 4 at redshift = -+ z 0.09 0.04 0.03 (median and 90{\%} credible range). Here, we report on the constraints these observations place on the rate of BBH coalescences. Considering only GW150914, assuming that all BBHs in the universe have the same masses and spins as this event, imposing a search FAR threshold of 1 per 100 years, and assuming that the BBH merger rate is constant in the comoving frame, we infer a 90{\%} credible range of merger rates between – --2 53 Gpc yr 3 1 (comoving frame). Incorporating all search triggers that pass a much lower threshold while accounting for the uncertainty in the astrophysical origin of each trigger, we estimate a higher rate, ranging from – --13 600 Gpc yr 3 1 depending on assumptions about the BBH mass distribution. All together, our various rate estimates fall in the conservative range – --2 600 Gpc yr 3 1 .},

abstract = {We review the results from multi-dimensional, time-dependent simulations of gas dynamics in AGN. We will focus on two types of outflows powered by radiation emitted from the AGN central engine: (i) outflows driven from the innermost part of an accretion disk and (2) outflows driven from a large-scale inflow that is likely the main supplier of material to the central engine. We discuss the relevance of both types of outflows to the so-called AGN feedback problem. However, the AGN feedback should not be considered separately from the AGN physics. Therefore, we also discuss the issue whether the properties of the same outflows are consistent with the gas properties in broad- and narrow-line regions.},

@article{Nakatani2017,
abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are thought to have lifetimes of several million years in the solar neighborhood, but recent observations suggest that the disk lifetimes are shorter in a low metallicity environment. We perform a suite of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks to study the disk structure and its long-term evolution of {\$}\backslashsim 10000{\$} years, and the metallicity dependence of mass-loss rate. Our simulations follow hydrodynamics, extreme and far ultra-violet radiative transfer, and non-equilibrium chemistry in a self-consistent manner. Dust grain temperatures are also calculated consistently by solving the radiative transfer of the stellar irradiation and grain (re-)emission. We vary the disk gas metallicity over a wide range of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\~{}} Z{\_}\backslashodot \backslashleq Z \backslashleq 10 {\~{}}Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The photoevaporation rate is lower with higher metallicity in the range of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} \backslash,Z{\_}\backslashodot \backslashlesssim Z \backslashlesssim 10 \backslash,Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, because dust shielding effectively prevents far-ultra violet (FUV) photons from penetrating into and heating the dense regions of the disk. The photoevaporation rate sharply declines at even lower metallicities in {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} \backslash,Z{\_}\backslashodot \backslashlesssim Z \backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}\backslash,Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, because FUV photoelectric heating becomes less effective than dust-gas collisional cooling. The temperature in the neutral region decreases, and photoevaporative flows are excited only in an outer region of the disk. At {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}\backslash,Z{\_}\backslashodot \backslashleq Z \backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslash,Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, HI photoionization heating acts as a dominant gas heating process and drives photoevaporative flows with roughly a constant rate. The typical disk lifetime is shorter at {\$}Z=0.3{\~{}}Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$} than at {\$}Z = Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, being consistent with recent observations of the extreme outer galaxy.},

abstract = {A module for the ZEUS-2D code is described that may be used to solve the equations of radiation hydrodynamics to order unity in v/c, in the {\~{N}}ux-limited di usion (FLD) approximation. In this approx-imation, the factor Eddington tensor f, which closes the radiation moment equations, is chosen to be an empirical function of the radiation energy density. This is easier to implement and faster than full-transport techniques, in which f is computed by solving the transfer equation. However, FLD is less accurate when the {\~{N}}ux has a component perpendicular to the gradient in radiation energy density and in optically thin regions when the radiation Ðeld depends strongly on angle. The material component of the {\~{N}}uid is here assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The energy equations are operator split, with transport terms, radiation di usion term, and other source terms evolved separately. Transport terms are applied using the same consistent transport algorithm as in ZEUS-2D. The radiation di usion term is updated using an alternating direction{\`{E}}implicit method with convergence checking. Remaining source terms are advanced together implicitly using numerical root Ðnding. However, when absorption opacity is zero, accuracy is improved by instead treating the compression and expansion source terms using a time-centered di erencing scheme. Results are discussed for test problems including radiation-damped linear waves, radiation fronts propagating in optically thin media, subcritical and supercritical radiating shocks, and an optically thick shock in which radiation dominates downstream pressure.},

@article{Levermore1981,
abstract = {A diffusion theory for radiative transfer is derived which is naturally flux limited, i.e., the magnitude of the flux can be no greater than the density times the maximum transport speed. Numerical comparisons with exact solutions of the equation of transfer indicate that this approxi-mate theory is significantly more accurate than classical isotropic diffusion theory (the Eddington approximation) and asymptotic diffusion theory. Subject heading: radiative transfer In many problems involving transport theory one is often forced by computational or cost considerations to adopt some approximate method to handle the transport phenomena. By far the most common such methods in use today involve approximating the angular information by various forms of the diffusion (differential) approximation, typically based upon equihbrium diffusion theory (EDT, Pomraning 1973), isotropic diffusion theory (IDT, Larsen and Keller 1974), or asymptotic diffusion theory (ADT, Pomraning 1973; Case, de Hoffmann, and Placzek 1953; Winslow 1968). All these theories impose restrictions on significant spatial variations over distances of a mean free path, and all yield expressions for the flux of energy or particles which can violate causality (the magnitude of the flux can be no greater than the density times the maximum transport speed) when these restrictions are exceeded. While these constraints are reasonable for many physical problems, they are often violated for radiative transfer problems that arise in astrophysics and plasma physics. In the past this has led to the ad hoc introduction of a flux-hmiter (Winslow 1968; Lund and Wilson 1980), usually with some degree of arbitrariness, in order to preserve causahty in the presence of large spatial gradients. It is the purpose of this paper to present a diffusion theory which is naturally flux-hmited, and thus relaxes some of the restrictions usually necessary for the valid application of diffusion theory. We will refer to this approximate transport description as flux-limited diffusion theory (FDT). The setting of what follows will be radiative transfer, although the analysis makes no special use of this fact and is equally applicable to any one-speed transport problem. The generalization to frequency dependent (multigroup) problems can be accomplished as Winslow (1968) did in the ADT setting. For simplicity, only the case of isotropic elastic (coherent) scattering will be treated here, but the procedure can be applied to a more general scattering description. The outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows: The next section derives the flux-hmited diffusion equation, and discusses various limiting forms of the theory, as well as its connection with IDT and ADT. The FDT equation obtained is nonlinear, but we show in III that certain problems are solvable in closed analytic form. Section IV discusses the initial and boundary conditions that are necessary to complete the theory, and numerical comparisons of IDT, ADT, and FDT with exact transport results are presented in V. We close with a few summary remarks in the where r, Q, and t are the spatial, angular, and temporal variables, c is the speed of light, a 0 (r, t) is the absorption coefficient, {\textless}j s (r, t) is the scattering coefficient, o—o a +{\textless}j 5 is the total interaction coefficient, Z?(r, t) is the blackbody energy density, and E(r,t) is the radiation energy density as defined by},

@article{Tetsu2016,
abstract = {Radiation is an important process of energy transport, a force, and a basis for synthetic observations, so radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) calculations have occupied an important place in astrophysics. However, although the progress in computational technology is remarkable, their high numerical cost is still a persistent problem. In this work, we compare the following schemes used to solve the nonlinear simultaneous equations of an RHD algorithm with the flux-limited diffusion approximation: the Newton–Raphson (NR) method, operator splitting, and linearization (LIN), from the perspective of the computational cost involved. For operator splitting, in addition to the traditional simple operator splitting (SOS) scheme, we examined the scheme developed by Douglas {\&} Rachford (DROS). We solve three test problems (the thermal relaxation mode, the relaxation and the propagation of linear waves, and radiating shock) using these schemes and then compare their dependence on the time step size. As a result, we find the conditions of the time step size necessary for adopting each scheme. The LIN scheme is superior to other schemes if the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure is sufficiently low. On the other hand, DROS can be the most efficient scheme if the ratio is high. Although the NR scheme can be adopted independently of the regime, especially in a problem that involves optically thin regions, the convergence tends to be worse. In all cases, SOS is not practical.},
