\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Courtesy: wikipedia. This stencil portraits the working of the ADI scheme, the first half time step from $t=n$ to $t = n +\frac {1}{2}$ depends implicitly on the cells with coordinates $(i+1,j)$, $(i,j)$ and $(i-1,j)$. The second half time step to $t = n+1$ depends implicitly on cells $(i,j+1)$, $(i,j)$ and $(i,j-1)$.}}{18}
